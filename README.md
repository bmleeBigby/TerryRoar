RawrDefend is an advanced behavioral-analysis and threat-correlation engine designed to augment existing SIEM platforms with real-time, high-fidelity detection capabilities. By ingesting log streams, network telemetry, and endpoint signals, RawrDefend applies adaptive machine-learning models to identify anomalies that evade signature-based tools. Its architecture emphasizes contextual enrichment—cross-referencing events against threat intelligence, identity patterns, and historical baselines—to surface stealthy lateral movement, privilege-escalation attempts, and multi-stage intrusion paths before they materialize into incidents.

Built for defenders who need clarity in noisy environments, RawrDefend provides actionable insights through a unified dashboard that highlights behavioral clusters, suspicious sequences, and environment-specific risks. Automated response workflows allow security teams to isolate suspicious hosts, trigger SOAR playbooks, or escalate incidents with precision. Whether deployed alongside an enterprise SIEM or integrated directly into an existing SOC pipeline, RawrDefend reduces alert fatigue, enhances detection depth, and empowers analysts with a sharper, AI-driven view of their threat landscape.
